Title: Convert 'ggplot2' to 'circos' Plot
Version: 0.9.0
Author: Houyun Huang <houyunhuang@163.com>
Maintainer: Houyun Huang <houyunhuang@163.com>
Description: In some cases, the polar-coordinate plot in 'ggplot2' are not flexible enough to meet
    actual needs. In contrast, the 'circlize' package is flexible enough, but too complex for
    beginners. This package provides a compromise solution that helps beginners to draw fast and
    well, and also allows advanced users to use flexibly.
